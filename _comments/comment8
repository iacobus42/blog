comment: 'Jacob,

  As one who has suffered at the hands of latency, I am glad to see what you have put together. I will try this out at my own home office and see what I see. I am curious though about the labels you have for the first two graphs: the first is rent vs. bedrooms and the second is lat(itude) vs. long(itude). Are you sure you have the right graphs in the post?

  Thanks,

  Paul'
