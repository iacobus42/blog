comment: "I've been trying to follow along with your code as you go but this has me confused:

  d$searched <- rank(-1 * d$valueOfSearch) <= 100
  d$newSearchValue <- bayesUpdate(d$searched, d$PrP, d$PrD)

  When I run that I get a vector of and TRUE and FALSE for d$searched, which makes sense I suppose. I'm not clear on how the bayesUpdate function can run with that. Does it read the vector as 1s and 0s?"
