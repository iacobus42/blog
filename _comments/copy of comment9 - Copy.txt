  I did use the R compiler library, using cmpfun() before running the functions took the run time down to about 2.4 seconds from 7 or 10.5. It is still slower than C or Python but it is faster. Given the extensive statistical codebase in CRAN, the slower performance is probably worth using R over Python for most analysis. pandas and other projects are improving but nothing comes close to CRAN.
