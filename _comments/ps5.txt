comment: 'Mis-specification in the PS model and mis-specification in the regression model are two different issues. A lot of literature encourages using very imparsimonious propensity models (many variables, interactions) as it is the predicted p, not the parameter estimates  or hypothesis tests, that matters.

  That said, it is also possible to put a lot of effort into testing the specification of the regression model. '
