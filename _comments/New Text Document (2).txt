comment: 'Phil,

  I totally agree the answer is in the data. Most people I work with are better off using domain knowledge because they have a lot more of that then they have of statistics. However, I really like methods like cross-validation, AIC and BIC as tools for model selection, including variable selection. I haven''t finished the video on your post or completely digested your code yet but your methods appear to be more complicated than simply bivariate analysis.

  My concern that I''m attempting to get at with this post is that bivariate correlations may not be informative about the model in k dimensions. People in public health (my "domain" background) often use simple correlation coefficients to include/exclude variables from the model. I don''t think that is an effective or harmless way to do variable selection in many cases. '
