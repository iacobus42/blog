comment: "I love this explanation of how to think about/visualize the problem!

  I have two questions, though:
  Since we're picking from the urn without replacement why does the code in the first part specify sampling with replacement?

  I'm not clear on where the pmf of Pr(M=m) comes from. If I read it correctly:
     The bottom term is the number of possible ways to draw a sample of size k from a set of size N.
     The top term is the number of possible ways to draw the remaining tanks (k-1) from a set of size m that has already had #m removed (m-1).
  What I don't understand is why these are the correct terms to define the pmf."
