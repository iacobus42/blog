<h2>About</h2>

<p>I working on a PhD in <a href="http://pharmacy.uiowa.edu/graduate-program-pharmaceutical-socioeconomics">Pharmaceutical Socioeconomics</a> and recently completed an MS in <a href="http://cph.uiowa.edu/epi/">Epidemiology</a> at the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>. I am interested in applied statistics and statistical computing with applications in health care/health economics. I am part of the <a href="http://compepi.cs.uiowa.edu/">Computational Epidemiology research group</a> at the University of Iowa. My CV can be found <a href="/documents/simmering-cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was inspired to start blogging by a post about <a href = "http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/">academic blogging by Matt Might</a>. I write about whatever I am interested in at the moment. Typically, this is directly related to statistics or statistical computing (especially with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>), but not always.</p>

<p>The posts are often widely spaced. I get distracted sometimes with real work.</p>

<p>I am playing around with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for this site as opposed to using something like Wordpress. As a result of that and the fact I only <i>just barely</i> know what I am doing, expect things to be broken and inconsistent for a while.</p>

<p>Other potentially important things are that I prefer dogs to cats and typically call carbonated drinks pop.</p> 

<p>Where possible, I share any code/data I work with for posts on this blog and under as permissible licensing as possible.</p>
