<p>In case you missed the obvious, I'm Jacob Simmering. By day, I am a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a> and by night, well, I am pretty much the same thing. I am interested in statistical computing and applied statistics, especially in the domains of healthcare and health economics.</p>

<p>Various projects doing fun and interesting stuff (by my standards) can be found at my <a href="http://www.github.com/iacobus42">GitHub page</a>. Commentary on those fun projects, or whatever else sounds interesting at the moment, will be found on my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>.</p>
